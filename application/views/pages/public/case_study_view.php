								<p>Financing of Solar Plant Using XinFin Hybrid Blockchain and IoT</p>
								<div id="video_1" class="collapse">
									<p>XinFin.org successfully demonstrated financing of a solar plant using blockchain technology. The simulation involved digitising and representing a solar plant on the blockchain.</p>
									<p>The buyer and financier entered in to a smart contract over the Blockchain and the solar plant was financed using the underlying XDC tokens.</p>
									<p>The IoT integration enabled real time monitoring and reporting of the plant performance. The IoT signal was fed to the smart contract between buyer and financier thereby triggering peer to peer wallet transfer toward repayment.</p>
